# SoleilEtSoie
CMPS202 Project Database Fall 2024
Soleil et Soie began as a small, family-run fashion house led by twin visionaries with a passion for timeless elegance. Initially, the business operations were managed on paper, but as the brand grew in popularity and expanded its offerings, the limitations of this system became apparent. Frequent issues such as misplaced records, delayed order processing, inventory mismatches, and unsatisfied customers began to surface, threatening their reputation. The inefficiencies of manual management proved unsustainable as they ventured into new markets with chic collections, perfumes, and makeup lines. Recognizing the need for a robust and scalable solution, the twins reached out to us to design a comprehensive database management system (DBMS) to streamline their operations, ensure accuracy, and uphold the exceptional standards that define Soleil et Soie.
